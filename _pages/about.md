I'm Emanuel, a curious mind at the intersection of biology, physics, programming and everything in between. My journey in science started with a deep fascination for the natural world, leading me to explore the mysteries of life through the lens of biological sciences.

But why stop there? I've always believed that the most exciting discoveries happen at the crossroads of disciplines. That's why I ventured into the world of Python, not just as a developer and data scientist, but as a bridge builder between different realms of knowledge.

One of my proudest moments was unraveling the secrets of spinal cord regeneration in axolotls, a study that found its home in the prestigious journal eLife. It was a thrilling experience to combine Python-based data analysis and modeling to shed light on such a complex biological process.

Currently, I'm pouring my energy into SysVert, a pioneering software project designed to delve into the intricacies of cellular tissue studies. It's a vertex model engine implemented in Python, blended with PyQt and Glumpy magic, that I hope will push the boundaries of systems biology.

My passion for merging biology and technology also led me to victory at the Bio x AI hackathon, where our team project ProteinBind used machine learning to decode the mysteries of protein mutations. And when I'm not knee-deep in research, I enjoy flexing my Python skills in app development, web scraping, image analysis and more.

Teaching has been another rewarding avenue for me. Sharing knowledge and igniting curiosity in students at the National University of La Plata has been an enriching experience. It's a joy to see young minds grasp the beauty of biology and the power of biophysics while helping them build critical minds.

As I continue my journey, I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate and innovate. Whether it's a postdoc position or a role in commercial or industry settings that taps into my unique blend of expertise, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
